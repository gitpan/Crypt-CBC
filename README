This is Crypt::CBC version 1.20, a Perl-only implementation of the
cryptographic cipher block chaining mode (CBC).  In combination with a
block cipher such as Crypt::DES or Crypt::IDEA, you can encrypt and
decrypt messages of arbitrarily long length.  The encrypted messages
are compatible with the encryption format used by B<SSLeay>.

In addition to this module you will need the following:

1. MD5
   Required for key and iteration vector generation.

2. Crypt::DES
   Required for the DES encryption algorithm.

3. Crypt::IEA
   Required for the IDEA encryption algorithm.

You can find each of these modules on a CPAN near you.  In order to
get the DES and IDEA modules to compile on my system (Linux), I found
I had to change a few of the #include directives.  For Crypt::DES, I
had to change "#include <machine/types.h>" to "#include <sys/types.h>"
in the "des.h" file.  For Crypt::IDEA, I had to make the same change
in the file "idea.h".  In addition, I had to change "#include
<machine/endian.h>" to "#include <endian.h>" in the file "idea.c".
Your mileage may vary.

To Install Crypt::CBC:

	1. perl Makefile.PL
	2. make
	3. make test
	4. make install
